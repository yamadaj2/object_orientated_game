# object_orientated_game
A simple console application, turn based fighting game, demonstrating basic principles of Object Orientated concepts, written in Ruby. 

Much effort was put in to ensure the code was clean as it could be. This includes using _intent revealing_ variable and method names, _small single purpose methods_, neatly organised classes, DRY code and unit tests. Much of the practices on clean code was taken from the book "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin
